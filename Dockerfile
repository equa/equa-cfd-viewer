# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.28
#
# cfd-viewer's own image: the server in `server` mode, the client inside its
# wheel. Shaped like the equa-ci service archetype's Dockerfile (web, builder,
# runtime), built from the lock (openspec standalone-viewer, design D9, and the
# viewer-build spec "One dependency set for every deployment").
#
# Not yet what cfd-backend ships: its `cfd-viz` image still clones this repo and
# runs main.py (see cfd-viewer/cfd-backend-switch.md in
# equa-platform-docs' module tree for the switch). Until then this
# image is meant to match cfd-viz where it matters -- same Python base, same
# uid, no GL libraries -- so that the switch changes how the image is built,
# not what runs in it.
#
#   podman build --format docker --build-arg SERVICE_VERSION=0.0.0-dev -t cfd-viewer:dev .
#   podman run --rm -p 5003:5003 -v ./data/hotRoom:/data/hotRoom:ro,Z cfd-viewer:dev
#
# --format docker: the OCI image format has no HEALTHCHECK, and podman drops it
# (with a warning) unless told to write a Docker-format image. buildx in CI
# writes Docker format anyway.
