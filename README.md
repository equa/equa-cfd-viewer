# equa-cfd-viewer — OpenFOAM post-processing in a browser

Serves a solved OpenFOAM case as an interactive 3-D visualization over HTTP,
aimed at what an IDA ICE CFD backend needs: open a case, pick a field, cut a
plane through the room, see where the air actually goes.

Built directly on VTK's native `vtkOpenFOAMReader` — no intermediate conversion,
no `foamToVTK`, no ParaView install.

## How it is put together

VTK does every CFD filter on the server; the browser draws the result. The
server extracts geometry per **part** — boundary, slice, isosurface,
streamlines, arrows, geometry — and ships plain triangles, line segments and
scalars (`src/equa/cfd_viewer/`: `foamviz/` + `server/`). The client turns those into `BufferGeometry`
and colors them in a shader (`web/`), so it knows no CFD at all.

That division is the point. Color map, range, banding, opacity, per-part
visibility, the camera and the streamline animation are shader uniforms or GPU
state, so they cost **no round trip**; only what has to be re-*extracted* does.

> 2026-09-12** and lives on the frozen **`trame` branch**. Nothing here depends
> on it. To look at it: `git show trame:foamviz/app.py`.

## Running it

Develop in **equa-ci's devcontainer**, with this checkout beside `equa-ci`
and `equa-platform-docs`: it mounts them all under `/workspaces/repos`, has
Chromium's libraries, and loads the `equa-dev` feed credentials that
`uv sync` needs from `equa-ci/.env`.

The server is the Python package `equa-cfd-viewer`, managed with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync                                          # Python env from uv.lock

# the client, once (and after changes to web/)
uv run doit web_build

# the server (serves web/dist at /)
uv run cfd-viewer --data ./data
```

Then open <http://localhost:5003/>. With no `?case=` in the address, the viewer
opens on a **start screen** listing every case it found (label, path, cell
count, decomposed or not), with a filter; one case only opens directly.

For UI work, run Vite's dev server instead — it hot-reloads and proxies `/api`
to the Python process:

```bash
uv run cfd-viewer --data ./data              # terminal 1
cd web && npm run dev                        # terminal 2 -> http://localhost:5173/
```

The options:

| Option | Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--data DIR`, or `DIR` as an argument | `CASE_ROOTS` | A directory of cases, or one case. Repeat for several roots (in the variable, separate them with `:`). Default `./data` in server mode, none in local mode |
| `--scan-depth N` | `SCAN_DEPTH` | Directory levels below each root to search for cases. Default 4. Cases are found at any level up to it, never inside another case, as cfd-backend finds them (e.g. its test cases in `CFD_HOME/tests/<name>`) |
| `--host`, `--port` | `PORT` | Server mode: default `0.0.0.0`, `5003`. Local mode: `127.0.0.1` only, on a free port |
| `--root-path PATH` | `ROOT_PATH` | Also serve under `PATH` (`/viewer`), for a proxy that does not strip it, as equa-deployment's Traefik does. Every route then answers under it *and* at the root; `PATH` redirects to `PATH/`. Default none |
| `--mode server` | | The default: an empty `--data` is not fatal, cases are picked up as they appear. `--server` is an alias |
| `--mode local` | | One user's own machine: listens on `127.0.0.1` only, opens the browser with a one-time token, and the start screen offers "Add folder", recent folders and "Quit viewer". A second launch joins the running one. The Windows bundle starts in this mode |
| `--no-browser` | | Local mode: print the URL, token included, instead of opening a browser |

An option on the command line wins over its variable. Local mode reads none of
the variables. The image sets
`CASE_ROOTS=/data` and `PORT=5003` and passes no options, so a platform's
settings take effect.

`python main.py ...` with `pip install -r requirements.txt` still works the old
way; that is how cfd-backend's `cfd-viz` image runs it (see
[the cockpit contract](#the-cockpit-contract)). Endpoints for tooling:
`/health`, and `/api/config` (mode, version). Local mode adds `/api/folders`
(browse and add), `/api/quit` and `/api/instance`, and answers 403 to any
request without its token or cookie.

`--data DIR` points at either a single case directory or a directory of them; a
case is anything containing `system/controlDict`. The bundled demo lives in
`data/hotRoom`.

### Opening an IDA ICE project

IDA ICE saves each CFD case of a project as `<project>/cfd/<case-id>.zip`. Add
the project folder, or a folder of projects, and its solved cases are listed
under their IDA ICE names; cases never run are left out. Nothing is unzipped to
list them. The first time a case is opened, its zip is unpacked into a per-user
cache (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\equa\cfd-viewer\cases` on Windows,
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/equa/cfd-viewer/cases` elsewhere), and reopening it reuses that
copy until IDA ICE saves the zip again. Nothing is written into the project.

The cache keeps an unpacked case for 48 hours after it was last opened. "Clear
case cache" on the start screen empties it at once, except the open case; with
a case open, "All cases" (beside the case switcher) brings the start screen
back.

### On Windows, without installing anything

Each release carries `cfd-viewer-<version>-win64.zip` and its `SHA256SUMS` on
its GitHub release page. Unzip it anywhere, no admin rights needed, and
double-click `cfd-viewer.exe`: the viewer opens in your browser, and "Add
folder" finds your cases. Dropping a folder onto `cfd-viewer.exe` opens it
directly. Close the console window, or choose "Quit viewer", to stop it.

The bundle is **unsigned** until EQUA's code-signing certificate is set up, so
Windows SmartScreen warns about it: unsigned zips are for internal testing
only. Recent folders are kept in `%APPDATA%\equa\cfd-viewer\settings.json`.

CI builds and smoke-tests the bundle on every push (the `windows` job). To build
it by hand on Windows, after `uv run doit web_build`:

```bash
uv sync --frozen --no-dev --group freeze --no-editable
uv run --no-sync pyinstaller --noconfirm packaging/windows/cfd-viewer.spec
```

### In a container

The repository's own `Dockerfile` builds the server with the client inside it,
from the lock file, on the same base and uid as cfd-backend's `cfd-viz`. Each
release publishes it as `ghcr.io/equa/equa-cfd-viewer`; to build one locally:

```bash
podman build --format docker --build-arg SERVICE_VERSION=0.0.0-dev -t cfd-viewer:dev .
podman run --rm -p 5003:5003 -v ./data/hotRoom:/data/hotRoom:ro,Z cfd-viewer:dev
```

`--format docker` keeps the image's `HEALTHCHECK`: Podman's default OCI format
has no health checks and drops it with a warning. `,Z` is for SELinux hosts such
as Fedora; it relabels the mounted directory.

Cases are read in place and never written to, so `/data` can be read-only.
cfd-backend still builds `cfd-viz` its own way, from a clone of this repository;
[The switch](https://github.com/equa/equa-platform-docs/blob/beta/docs/platform/modules/cfd-viewer/cfd-backend-switch.md) describes moving it to
this image, and what can be removed here once it has.

### Deep-linking a case, and the theme

`?case=<id or name>` opens a specific case directly, e.g.
<http://localhost:5003/?case=hotRoom>. Every case has a stable 12-character
**id** (from its root and path, shown in the case switcher); its directory
**name** works too as long as exactly one case has it. An unknown or ambiguous
`?case=` is a 404, and the page falls back to the start screen with a notice,
never to a different case. `?theme=light|dark` sets the color scheme (default
dark). Both are what let a host application embed the viewer for one case in
an `<iframe>` and have it match the surrounding app.

Cases are read **in place and never written to** (no `.foam` marker is created),
so case directories can be read-only: a network share, or a `:ro` mount.

### Which VTK

Plain `vtk` from PyPI, **9.4 or newer**, and **no GL library at all** -- not
for the server, not for the tests. The server never renders: it only extracts
geometry, and the browser draws it. `FoamPipeline` builds no render window
(VTK needs a GL backend present just to *construct* one), and since
2026-10-23 there is nothing left that renders server-side: `screenshot()`,
`write_vtkjs()` and `pick_cor()` were the Trame front end's and are gone.
`tests/test_pipeline.py` replaces `vtk.vtkRenderWindow` with a stub that
raises, so a render window cannot creep back unnoticed; cfd-backend's smoke
test checks the same from its side. Neither image (cfd-backend's `cfd-viz`,
nor this repository's) installs `libosmesa6` or `libgl1`.

If you ever do want VTK to render -- an ad-hoc script, say -- the stock wheels
carry EGL and OSMesa render windows and `dlopen` the libraries, so install
`libosmesa6` (or `mesa-libOSMesa`) first. `vtk-osmesa` is a dead end: not on
PyPI, frozen at 9.3.1, CPython 3.12 at most.

## What it does

| Tool | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Color** (top bar) | Any field the case contains; magnitude or X/Y/Z for vectors; nine color maps; automatic, percentile (1–99 %) or manual range; discrete bands; opacity weighted by value |
| **Cut plane** | An X/Y/Z-aligned plane positioned by world coordinate — the anchor for everything below. Optionally a *crinkle* slice: the true cell layer rather than a flat cut |
| **Boundary** | The room shell, neutral or field-colored, with near-wall culling so you can see in, mesh edges, opacity, cut-away-at-plane, and per-patch read selection |
| **Isosurfaces** | 1 / 3 / 5 nested isosurfaces of the colored field, or **locked** to a field of their own — so you can contour speed and color by temperature |
| **Streamlines** | RK45 integration seeded from the cut plane, as lines or **tubes built in the browser** (so the representation and the width are instant). **Animate flow** sends comets along them at the local flow speed — which is also the only thing that shows a streamline's *direction* |
| **Arrows** | Glyphs on the plane (an even grid) or on the isosurface, uniform length or scaled by magnitude |
| **Geometry** | The building outline from `constant/triSurface/building*.obj`, as feature edges or full wireframe |
| Bottom bar | Time-step player, six axis-aligned camera presets plus iso, time re-scan |
| Keyboard | `x`/`y`/`z` look down an axis (shift for the far side), `r` reframes, `f` sets the center of rotation under the cursor |

The cut plane deliberately drives the slice, the stream seeds *and* the arrows.
For room airflow that matches how a result actually gets read: choose a plane,
then ask what the air is doing on it.

Streamline **tubes are built in the browser** from the line data, not shipped.
`vtkTubeFilter`'s output was 9x the wire for no saving in server time (measured
on a 2.3 M-cell case: 10.30 MB gzipped against 1.13 MB) since the tracer
dominates either way. Inflating locally takes a few milliseconds, makes the
lines/tubes switch instant, and turns the width into a shader uniform — it
displaces the tube's centerline along the ring normal, so dragging it rebuilds
nothing.

The streamline animation is an animated dash pattern rather than particles — no
particle buffer, no per-frame CPU work, one uniform. It rides the transport time
`vtkStreamTracer` already computes (`IntegrationTime`), so the comets move at
the **local flow speed** and visibly rip through a plume while crawling in the
corners. Try it with **Tubes** on: on 1-px lines a comet is a short bright
segment that gets lost in a coiled tangle, on tubes it is a discrete object.
Tubes cost nothing now, so there is no reason not to.

### Which controls cost a round trip

The viewer labels every control `server` or `client`, because the difference is
worth seeing while you use it:

- **client** — color map, range, bands, opacity-by-value, per-part visibility,
  opacity, color-by-field and its solid-color fallback, near-wall culling,
  shell mesh edges, the streamline animation, camera, lighting, theme. These are
  shader uniforms or GPU state: instant, no request.
- **server** — color *field* and component, cut-plane position, isovalues, the
  isosurface's locked field, seed and glyph counts, time step, patch selection,
  crinkle slice, true cell values. These change what has to be extracted.
  Robust range and **Rescale** are the exception: they change no geometry, so
  they come from a cheap `/api/range` rather than re-extracting anything.

Server-side controls commit **on release**, and the heavy groups (streamline
tuning, the plane's numeric X/Y/Z fields, patch selection) sit behind an
**Apply** button, so a drag or a half-typed number never queues an extraction.

Extraction is also **per part**: moving the cut plane re-extracts the slice
(tens of kB) and leaves the boundary surface (15 MB on a 2.3 M-cell case)
untouched on the GPU. Decoded parts are cached by request signature, so going
back to a time step or slice position you have already visited is free.

## Demo cases

Both are versioned **with their results**, ASCII and tiny, so a fresh checkout
runs every suite without OpenFOAM. They are test fixtures, not showcases: point
`--data` at a real case to see what the viewer does at scale.

`data/hotRoom` is OpenFOAM 13's `fluid/hotRoomBoussinesqSteady` tutorial on a
coarse 10×5×10 mesh (500 cells of 1 m) -- a 10 × 5 × 10 m room with 4 m² of
floor held at 600 K. It converges at iteration 740; `purgeWrite 2` keeps the
time steps `0`, `700` and `740`, enough for the time player to step through.
About 400 kB. `constant/triSurface/building.obj` is a small added fixture (a
box at the room bounds) that exercises the Geometry tool. Chosen as the closest
tutorial analog to an IDA ICE `HEATING` case: buoyancy-driven room airflow
with a thermal plume, steady state, and genuinely 3-D.

`data/cavity` is the lid-driven cavity for the `fluid` solver: 20×20×1 (400
cells, 2-D), times `0`, `0.5`, `1`, about 330 kB. It makes the start screen
list more than one case.

To regenerate either (OpenFOAM 13 sourced):

```bash
cd data/hotRoom && ./Allclean && ./Allrun
```

Then re-record the HTTP contract (`uv run python tools/record_contract.py`)
and review its diff: the replay compares values only while the case files
match the recording.

### The cockpit contract

cfd-backend's `cfd-viz` image is built from a **clone of a release tag of this
repository** (`VIZ_BRANCH` in its `Containerfile`): it needs `web/package.json`, `web/package-lock.json`,
`requirements.txt` and `main.py` at the root, installs with
`pip install -r requirements.txt` on Python 3.14, runs
`python main.py --server --data "$CFD_HOME" ...`, and its smoke test imports
`foamviz.pipeline` from the checkout root. So that layout is a contract, kept by
three shims (`main.py`, the top-level `foamviz/` alias and a generated
`requirements.txt`) and checked on every `doit ci` by
`tests/check_cockpit_contract.py`. Its HTTP behavior is a contract too:
`tests/test_contract.py` replays recorded responses: the API may only grow
(fields, types and statuses are always checked), and while the demo data and
library versions match the recording, values and geometry bytes must match too. [The switch](https://github.com/equa/equa-platform-docs/blob/beta/docs/platform/modules/cfd-viewer/cfd-backend-switch.md)
is the way out of the layout half.

### Design decisions worth knowing

**Color scalars are baked into an array.** Instead of asking a mapper for "the
magnitude of U" at render time, `pipeline.py` computes a plain scalar array
(`FoamVizColor`) and colors by that. Vector modes on a lookup table are a
render-side concept that does not survive being shipped to a browser, so baking
them means the client receives a number per vertex and makes the data range
trivially correct. It also means isosurfaces contour whatever you are
currently coloring by, which turns out to be the intuitive behavior.

**The reader is pulled, not connected.** `FoamCase.load()` requests a time step
and hands downstream filters a concrete snapshot via `SetInputData`. Requesting
time through a connected pipeline means every downstream `Update()`
re-negotiates the time request, and it is easy to silently fall back to `t=0`.

**Patch selection is a read-time filter.** Deselecting patches stops the reader
from loading them at all rather than hiding actors, which is the part that
matters once cases get large.

**The wire format is not glTF, on purpose.** glTF's material model has no
concept of a scalar field, so carrying `|U|` per vertex would mean either baking
vertex colors server-side — which kills client-side re-coloring, the one
interaction that must never cost a round trip — or smuggling values through a
custom accessor. `server/wire.py` ships raw typed arrays that map 1:1 onto
`THREE.BufferAttribute` instead: one fetch, one `arrayBuffer()`, zero parsing.

## Tests

```bash
uv run doit ci                     # everything a change must pass, ~3 min
uv run doit list                   # the separate tasks: lint, test_py, test_ui, wheel_check, ...
```

`doit ci` runs ruff, markdownlint and cspell, pytest, the browser suite, the
client build, a check that the wheel carries the client, a check that
`requirements.txt` matches the lock and the cockpit contract. The suites
also run directly:

```bash
uv run python tests/test_pipeline.py            # 64 checks, no browser, no GL: the VTK pipeline
uv run python tests/check_client.py             # 115 checks: the client in real Chromium
uv run python tests/test_contract.py            # 56 recorded HTTP exchanges, replayed
uv run python tests/check_cockpit_contract.py   # cfd-backend's cfd-viz build, mirrored
uv run pytest tests/test_sources.py tests/test_endpoints.py
uv run python tests/bench.py hotRoom s2         # server-side extraction sizes and timings
```

Nothing needs a system GL library (see "Which VTK"). The browser suite needs
Playwright's Chromium, which brings its own software GL (SwiftShader), plus
Chromium's usual system libraries: `doit` installs the browser itself (task
`chromium`), and as root also the libraries, as in CI. The cockpit check runs
cfd-backend's `viz.sh` from a checkout next to this one when there is one, and
otherwise the copy in `tests/cockpit/` -- which must match the checkout's
whenever both exist.

Commit messages follow Conventional Commits. The checks run as git hooks once
installed: `uv run pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-commit`.

`test_pipeline.py` checks the reader and every representation by **output
size**, not by exit status: an empty VTK filter raises nothing and renders as a
perfectly plausible blank image, so the only useful question is whether geometry
came out the other end.

`check_client.py` mostly does not ask "did it render". It asks **which controls
cause a refetch**, because that boundary is the architecture and it is the kind
of thing that decays silently — add one dependency to a hook and changing the
color map re-extracts the mesh, with no symptom beyond the app feeling slow on
a big case. So it counts `/api/scene` requests around nearly every interaction:
zero for a color-map switch, zero for a whole cut-plane drag, exactly one for
the release, and zero for returning to a cached time step. It also asserts the
red plane outline actually appears mid-drag by counting red pixels.

The browser suite reads rendered pixels through a `readPixels` hook in the page
rather than from a screenshot: the HUD, legend and busy overlay sit on top of
the canvas, so a page screenshot of an *empty* scene comes back colorful.

## Where this would need work for production

- **Multiple users.** One process holds one VTK pipeline and one open case.
  Extraction now runs in a worker thread behind a lock, so a long
  `vtkStreamTracer` no longer freezes the whole server, but two users still
  share one case. Concurrency needs a process per session.
- **Boundary decimation.** 15 of a 2.3 M-cell case's 16.2 MB raw payload is the
  boundary at full mesh resolution, mostly flat walls. gzip takes the whole
  payload to 24 %, which made this non-urgent rather than solved; patch
  selection helps immediately, `vtkQuadricDecimation` is the real fix.
- **Report figures.** "Add to case report" is not built here yet, and needs a
  decision first: does the image come from the client canvas (matching what the
  user sees, bands and opacity included) or from a server render (which would
  need every appearance setting to travel with the request)? The mothballed
  Trame app wrote them, so the format exists — see `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Comfort metrics.** The IDA ICE side cares about draught rate, PMV/PPD and
  operative temperature, none of which are OpenFOAM fields. They would be
  derived arrays computed on load — a natural extension of the same baked-array
  mechanism used for coloring.

Scale is *not* on this list: tested to 12 M cells, and measured on a 15.8 M-cell
IDA ICE case: 13 s to open, a 25 MB gzipped boundary, and **7.3 GB peak RAM**
(6.6 GB settled). The server's memory settles near the largest case opened, so
plan for about 0.45 GB per million cells. Note that an IDA ICE "zone"
is a room selected for analysis, not an OpenFOAM `cellZone` — cases are treated
as single-region, single-zone. Decomposed (`processor*`) cases are read via
`vtkPOpenFOAMReader` and are supported.
