"""Scene extraction: VTK on the server, triangles on the wire.

One open case plus the shared :class:`~foamviz.pipeline.FoamPipeline` filter
graph, driven by a flat query and packed by :mod:`server.wire`. The browser
draws the result with three.js and knows no CFD (see ``web/``).

The unit of work is a **part** -- ``boundary``, ``slice``, ``iso``, ``stream``,
``glyph``, ``geometry``. A request names the parts it wants and the server
extracts only those, so moving the cut plane costs a slice (tens of kB) and not
the boundary surface (15 MB on ``s2``). The client owns the decision, because it
is the side that knows what it still has cached: each part has a *signature*
built from exactly the inputs that change its geometry (:data:`PART_INPUTS`),
and the client re-requests a part only when its signature moves. That is the one
thing this path can do that the Trame path structurally cannot -- there, every
control re-executes the whole filter graph.

Appearance is not here. Colour map, colour range, bands, per-part visibility and
opacity are uniforms in the client's shader, so they never reach this module;
what the server owns is what has to be re-*extracted*. ``PART_INPUTS`` is the
written-down form of that boundary.

        This is the expensive one -- ``vtkStreamTracer`` is 2.6 s of the 3.1 s

        It is why the streamline panel keeps an Apply button.

        **Tubes are not built here any more.** ``vtkTubeFilter`` only inflates
        data the browser can inflate itself, and shipping the result is ~9x the
        wire for no saving in server time: measured on ``s2``, 10.30 MB gzipped
        against 1.13 MB for the same streamlines as lines, with the tracer
        dominating both (3.4 s either way). The client builds the tube from the
        line points and the polyline offsets (``web/src/viewer/tube.js``), which
        also makes the tubes/lines toggle and the tube width instant rather than
        a round trip. ``pipeline.stream_tube`` stays for the resting Trame app,
        which still renders its tubes server-side.
