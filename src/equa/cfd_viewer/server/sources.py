"""Where cases come from: one or more directories, scanned on demand.

A *case source* lists the cases it can see and turns a ``?case=`` key into a
directory VTK can read. Phase 1 has one kind, :class:`DirectorySource`; the
hosted viewer's uploads (openspec standalone-viewer, design D7) become a second
kind with the same two methods.

Listing is deliberately cheap -- it runs on every ``/api/cases`` and every
``?case=`` lookup, so a case written after start-up shows up without a restart
-- and never constructs a VTK reader: what it reports (label, cell count,
decomposed) comes from ``metadata.json`` and the mesh header alone.

Identity
--------
A case has an **id**, a short hash of its root and its path below that root:
stable across restarts and rescans, unique across roots, and free of host paths.
``?case=`` takes an id, or a directory **name** when exactly one listed case has
it -- which is what keeps the cfd-backend cockpit's ``/viz/?case=<uuid-dir>``
working. A name that matches several cases, or nothing, is an error the HTTP
layer turns into a 404; the old behaviour of opening the first case instead is
gone on purpose.

Discovery depth
---------------
Server mode finds cases the way cfd-backend does: its ``cfd_cases.find`` takes
every directory below ``CFD_HOME`` that has ``system/controlDict``, at any
depth (``rglob``), and the cockpit links a case by its directory name. So the
viewer searches every level too, bounded by ``depth`` -- directory levels below
a root, :data:`SERVER_SCAN_DEPTH` by default -- so a stray deep tree cannot
slow every request. Test-suite cases, for one, live in ``CFD_HOME/tests/<name>``,
which the old one-level scan never saw (found at the phase-1 gate, 2026-10-22).

A root is always scanned, and listed when it is itself a case (``find_cases``
did the same). Below it, a case directory is not descended into -- a case holds
no cases, and pruning there is what keeps the walk cheap -- and neither are
``processor*`` or numeric time directories. Hidden directories are searched,
as the backend searches them.

Names must be unique for the cockpit's links to work; the backend relies on
that as well (``/api/wd/ls/<name>`` takes the first match). Where they are not,
a name is ambiguous here and gets a 404 listing the ids, rather than the
backend's silent first match.

The backend also lists "bare" cases (``building.opf`` + ``geometry/building.obj``,
not yet meshed); there is nothing to view in those, so they are left out.
