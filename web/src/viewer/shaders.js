/*
 * The whole appearance pipeline, in about forty lines of GLSL.
 *
 * This is the payoff of the split: anything that is a *transfer function* in
 * VTK is a *uniform* here, and a uniform is instant. Colour map, colour range,
 * band count and the opacity ramp therefore cost no round trip and no
 * re-extraction -- where the Trame path has to rebuild a
 * vtkColorTransferFunction and re-serialise it, and could not do the opacity
 * ramp at all (the discretizable CTF does not serialise to vtk.js; reverted).
 *
 * The price, and it is real: every setting the shader owns is a setting the
 * server does not know. A server-side render (a report PNG) will not match this
 * view unless these values travel with the render request.

 *
 * An animated dash pattern, which is all a "particle" needs to be: `travel` is
 * per-vertex transport time along the streamline (server/scene.py bakes it from

 * advances at the LOCAL FLOW SPEED without anything moving on the CPU. No
 * particle buffer, no re-seeding, no per-frame JS: one uniform.
 *
 * Because travel is real transport time and not arc length, comets speed up
 * where the flow is fast -- ~32x variation along the demo case's streamlines --
 * which is the point. It also gives the streamlines something they simply did
 * not have before: a visible DIRECTION. A static streamline is
 * direction-ambiguous.
 *
 * `fract` of (phase - travel) puts the head at f == 0 and the tail just behind
 * it: a point slightly upstream has slightly larger f, so an exponential decay
 * in f trails the comet upstream, which is the way a tail points.
 *
 * uComets == 0 must be an exact no-op -- glow 0 and dim 1, so the fragment is
 * bit-identical to the un-animated one.
